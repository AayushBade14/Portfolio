        <hr noshade>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>"Well, well... Look, who do we have here?" Aren't you tired already from the last blog? I mean it was kind of a math monster, won't you agree? Compared to the <a href="../part2/part2.html">last-blog</a> this is going to be a cake walk. Yeah, trust me... See it for yourself. But yeah this topic is quite important, The camera transformation allows to see the world through the lens of a sweet-little virtual-camera. This will give you the ability to attach this camera to your game-character and follow it and do a lot's of cool stuff. Like you can attach this camera to a FPS-hands model and baammmm! you've made yourself a simple fps setup, and now you can make the camera move based on inputs from keyboard for walking and looking around with mouse movements. I hope this hypes you up for what comes next.... Tons of Math! Lol..</p>
        <br>

          <h5>Fig-3.1: Yeah! you can create such fps/tps-setup after learning this, you'll surely be able to build a character controller.</h5>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Now, let's start by understanding what a virtual-camera is in the first place. It is as its name suggests, a camera that we define in code (simply mathematical-transformations) and do not mistake it by any floating object in our game world... NO! (большое нет), we apply this so-called virtual-camera transform to each and everything we render in our virtual-world and this transforms or changes objects positions as seen throught the lens of our virtual-camera. Before we define our virtual-camera using the mathematical-construct, let's undestand how basis-transformation works and what is it exactly, as this is the meat of our camera-transformation.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Basis vectors are orthonormal vectors, meaning that they are normalized(having magnitude = 1) and are mutually-perpendicular to each-other. Just like the <b>Canonical Basis</b>, - \(\{x,y,z\}\) which are mutually-perpendicular to each other and all have a unit volume. These basis are represented as vectors as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        x = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\
        0 \\
        0 
        \end{pmatrix}
        \; y = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        1 \\
        0 
        \end{pmatrix}
        \; z = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
        1 
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Any coordinate-system/frame is defined by a point \(P\)(origin) and \(\{u,v,w\}\) its basis vectors. Our <b>Canonical Frame</b> is defined by the origin \(O=(0,0,0)\) and the basis vectors \(\{x,y,z\}\). Now that we understand what a coordinate-system/frame is, we can move forward and understand the change of basis through an example. <br><br><b>Case1:</b> Say we have a car-racing game and the player sees the world in a first-person view, that is they see the world through the windshield of the car. Now we do a trick when the car moves, we keep the car's dashboard and everything as a static overlay, drawn on top of the world which just moves in the opposite direction. Here, we can safely say that the coordinate-system/frame or our frame-of-reference is the car and the world moves with-respect-to this car/frame-of-reference.<br><br><b>Case2:</b> Another way to see this is, say our racing game is now in third-person view and we see the car from a camera floating above it. Now it makes sense to keep the world static and move the car around with-respect-to the frame-of-reference, which is the world-origin. Take a look at <a href="#fig-3.2">Fig-3.2</a> for a better understanding.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Now, the point of this analogy was to explain the fact that any point in the world can be defined with-respect-to different frame-of-references. For example, your favourite pizza place might be 200m away from your place, but might be miles away from mine. See, all depends on the frame-of-reference, who's the observer, the observer decides it all. Take a look at <a href=></p>

        T_2 = 
        \begin{pmatrix}

        0 & \frac{y_h' - y_l'}{y_h - y_l} & 0 \\

        <br>
        <br>
        <h3><b>Step-3</b></h3>
        <p>Finally we just translated our freshly scaled window to the position of window - \(w2\) by adding \((x_l',y_l')\) to each points coordinate of the window-rectangle. This can again be done using a 2d-homogenous / \(3 \times 3\) translation matrix as follows: </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        T_3 = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & x_l' \\
        0 & 1 & y_l' \\
        0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Finally we can convert this into a single mapping transformation matrix by chaining all these individual transforms as follows: </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        T = T_3 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_1 \\

        <br>
        <p>So you might ask, "What does this matrix exactly do?". I've just got the answer for it. It takes the content of the window - \(w1\) and projects them onto window - \(w2\). In simpler terms, it is just like you take out all the things you packed inside a briefcase for a lovely vacation in the Bahamas, you take those packed-items and try to place them in the same position as you placed them into the previous briefcase into a new briefcase of different size. Take a look at the illustration in <a href="#fig-2.5">Fig-2.5</a></p>

        <p>Alas! Now you don't have much space to get some goodies from the Bahamas for your girlfriend :(<br>But, look on the positive sides, folks! We just understood how the window/rectangle mapping works in action with all the depth there is to it. Now We can apply same concept to map or project a cuboid - \(c1\) to a cuboid - \(c2\) by extending it to 3d-homogenous space and using a \(4 \times 4\) transformation matrix as follows: </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Now, you might ask "How the hell does a cuboid map to another cuboid?", The answer is simple, the rectangular part maps the same as we did before and was well understood with the briefcase analogy. Now, for the third dimension imagine layers of things packed into the briefcase that have to be transferred in the same manner, earlier we scaled along 2 dimensions, now we also squeeze it from top so that all the stuff fits into a more compact briefcase. Watch a pro like Mr. Bean do it, fr... Lol XD.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Now, that the groundwork is out of our ways. It's time to understand what Orthographic projection truly is. Let's dive deeper into it.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3><b>Understanding Orthographic Projection</b></h3>
        <p>Orthographic projection is nothing but a parallel projection, we send out parallel rays of ligts and it preserves the actual dimensions of an object. The viewing volume, which is the volume we define. It is nothing but bounds in 3-dimensions till where we can see objects, outside of it objects are not visible or clipped. The viewing volume remains a cuboid in case of orthographic projection. According to the OpenGL conventions, we assume the camera is pointing along \(-Z\)-axis and the view volume is axis-aligned, that is it's faces are parallel to the coordinate axes. We need to define the left, right, bottom, top, near and front bounds for the view volume cuboid. Let's say we set the bounds to \(l, r, b, t, n, f\). Take a look at <a href="#fig-2.7">Fig-2.7</a> below.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="figure" id="fig-2.7">
          <img src="../assets/ortho_vv.jpg"/>
          <h5>Fig-2.7: View volume for orthographic projection</h5>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It is evident from the figure that the cuboid is defined as follows: <br>\(x \in [l,r] \\ y \in [b,t] \\ z \in [n,f] \)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In orthographic projection, we map/project this cuboid/view-volume we just defined above to something known as the canonical view-volume. Which as discussed in the previous blog is defined as follows: <br> \(x \in [-1, 1] \\ y \in [-1, 1] \\ z \in [0, 1]\)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It is just as we did when projecting a cube \(c1\) onto another cube \(c2\). And we can directly use that result here and plug in our values, but remember when deriving our result. We had \((x_l, y_l)\) and \((x_h, y_h)\). Similarly here we can see that it is: \((l,b,n)\) and \((r,t,f)\) & \((x_l',y_l')\) and \((x_h',y_h')\) is the coordinates we have to map to, in this case this is the canonical view-volume, so it'll be: \((-1,-1,1)\) and \((1,1,1)\). Let's plug-in these values into the <a href="#result-2.2">result we derived earlier</a>, into the T-matrix as follows: </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        T = \begin{pmatrix}
            \frac{x_h' - x_l'}{x_h - x_l} & 0 & 0 & \frac{x_l' \cdot x_h - x_h' \cdot x_l}{x_h - x_l} \\
            0 & \frac{y_h' - y_l'}{y_h - y_l} & 0 & \frac{y_l' \cdot y_h - y_h' \cdot y_l}{y_h - y_l} \\
           0 & 0 & \frac{z_h' - z_l'}{z_h - z_l} & \frac{z_l' \cdot z_h - z_h' \cdot z_l}{z_h - z_l} \\
           0 & 0 & 0 & 1
           \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Let's call our matrix \(M_{ortho}\) as T sounds too generic :D</p>
        <br>
        <br>
       $$
        T = \begin{pmatrix}

        <br>
        <p>Wow, that was a lot! We finally have our orthographic projection matrix, that maps/projects our arbitrary view-volume onto the canonical view-volume. But no projection is complete without being followed by a viewport-transform. It is nothing but projection a 2d axis-aligned rectangle onto another axis-aligned rectangle. Here we want to map this canonical view-volume which is 3d to a viewport/window, a 2d rectangle where we wanna see it. Now this sounds mind-bending right? How can we even project 3d onto 2d?? It's similar to projecting a 2d vector onto a single axis, what we call as breaking a 2d vector into it's 1d components. In simpler terms, imagine our canonical view-volume to be a stack of transparent sheets, which has some drawings on it. Now when you place them on top of each other in the right order based on it's \(z\)-value and observe it from the front, you see a beautiful image, all individual layers coming together to form a single image. Viewport transform is just like that. Take a look at <a href="#fig-2.8">Fig-2.8</a>.</p>

        <p>Now that we've understood this, we can use the window-transform result we obtained at the start and just plug in our values. In this case our \((x_l, y_l)\) will be \((-1,-1)\) and \((x_h, y_h)\) will be \((1,1)\). For the primed-coordinates we'll have to derive one more thing. Let's assume our window/framebuffer is \(n_x\)-pixels wide and \(n_y\)-pixels tall. We have to be a bit clever here, Let's start by understanding a pixel, it's a box and is indexed with it's center and spans \(0.5\)-units on all 4-directions of it's center. So in this case, our \((x_l',y_l')\) wil be \((-0.5, -0.5)\) and \((x_h', y_h')\) will be \((n_x + 0.5, n_y + 0.5)\). Take a look at <a href="#fig-2.9">Fig-2.9</a> if the derivation is unclear.</p>

        <p>Now, let's plug those bad boys into the <a href="#result-2.1">formula we derived above</a> as follows: </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        T = \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{x_h' - x_l'}{x_h - x_l} & 0 & \frac{x_l' \cdot x_h - x_h' \cdot x_l}{x_h - x_l} \\
        0 & \frac{y_h' - y_l'}{y_h - y_l} & \frac{y_l' \cdot y_h - y_h' \cdot y_l}{y_h - y_l} \\
        0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        T = \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{(n_x + 0.5) - (-0.5)}{(1) - (-1)} & 0 & \frac{(-0.5) \cdot (1) - (n_x + 0.5) \cdot (-1)}{(1) - (-1)} \\
        0 & \frac{(n_y + 0.5) - (-0.5)}{(1) - (-1)} & \frac{(-0.5) \cdot (1) - (n_y + 0.5) \cdot (-1)}{(1) - (-1)} \\
        0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        T = \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{n_x}{2} & 0 & \frac{n_x - 1}{2} \\
        0 & \frac{n_y}{2} & \frac{n_y - 1}{2} \\
        0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>But, this is for 2d, we need to consider \(z\)-axis aswell, although we don't change it but we want it for the depth information later when we wanna do depth-testing so to keep it we add a row and column to carry the z-coordinate without changing it as follows: </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="figure" id="result-2.4">
        <b>
        $$
        M_{vp} = \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{n_x}{2} & 0 & 0 & \frac{n_x - 1}{2} \\
        0 & \frac{n_y}{2} & 0 & \frac{n_y - 1}{2} \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        </b>
        <h5>Result-2.4: Viewport projection matrix</h5>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And we call it the <a href="#result-2.4">\(M_{vp}\)</a> matrix. And finally we are ready to perform orthographic projection on any 4d vector in 3d-homogenous space. We first apply the <a href="#result-2.3">\(M_{ortho}\)</a> matrix to it, followed by the <a href="#result-2.4">\(M_{vp}\)</a> matrix to present our object onto the screen, under orthographic projection. Do note that we are using the column-major format and we multiply these transformation matriceson the left of the vector and they are applied in the right-to-left order.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        $$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        x_{pixel} \\
        y_{pixel} \\
        z_{canonical} \\
        1
        \end{pmatrix}

        = (M_{vp} \cdot M_{ortho}) \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
                                          x \\
                                          y \\
                                          z \\
                                          1 
                                          \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Now doing all that jazz, we get the exact integer-coordinates \((x_{pixel},y_{pixel})\) with which we can just index into the framebuffer for a particular pixel and we get \(z_{ndc} or z_{canonical}\) which is just the normalized \(z-coordinate \in [-1,1]\) and later after rasterization we can perform depth-testing and for that we've to map this \(z-coordinate -> [0,1]\), which can be achieved by this formula \(\frac{1 + z_{ndc}}{2}\)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Voila! We've successfully understood the math behind doing orthographic projection and viewport transformation. If you have made it till here, you are definitely a courageous one! That was a lot to grasp. But most of our groundwork is laid here and in later continuations of this blog, I'll be referring to results from here and it'll be much shorter I promise. Peace! :D</p>
